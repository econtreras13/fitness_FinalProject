Hello!

This web app is for people who are into fitness to sign up and showcase their skills! 

A person can sign up and link their instagram account.
Users can veiw the application and see what sorts of cool stuff people can do in the world!

Tech info:

This app is built on the following:
1. HTML / CSS
2. NodeJS
3. Utilizes JSON data 
4. AJAX

For storing jsons, I used this online tool called myjson-

http://myjson.com/

This site was useful for using test data as you can see in the test json. I was able to store it on the site and then use AJAX to get the data back and display the contents.

In order to run this locally:

1. In terminal, execute npx http-server
2. Navigate to the localhost that the terminal tells you to go to

STYLING

I found a free css template to start working off of and I started tweaking it as needed. I didn't need the Google maps api functionality and a lot of extra things so those were removed. 

REFERENCES

1. Stack overflow: needed help researching why I couldn't append to an element. I came to realize that my id was "#dancers" so I had to change it to "dancers". 
2. Node Documentation: This was helpful for researching various ways to run my project locally. I ended up using npx http-server to run it and start from my index.html
