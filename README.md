# fitness_FinalProject

Hello!

This web app is for people who are into fitness to sign up and showcase their skills! 

A person can sign up and link their instagram account.
Users can veiw the application and see what sorts of cool stuff people can do in the world!

Tech info:

This app is built on the following:
1. HTML
2. ReactJS
3. NodeJS
4. Utilizes JSON data 
5. AJAX

For storing jsons, I used this online tool called myjson-

http://myjson.com/

This site was useful for using test data as you can see in the test json. I was able to store it on the site and then use AJAX to get the data back and display the contents.

In order to run this locally:

1. In terminal, execute npx http-server
2. Navigate to the localhost that the terminal tells you to go to
